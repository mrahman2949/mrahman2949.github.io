title: Control the remote control of a RC Car with Raspberry Pi (Zero, 2 or 3)
---

Are you new to raspberry pi? May be you have never gone beyond making an LED blink. Well in that case I have just the project for you. This is fairly easy and simple way you can control a remote control car and make your own script to make the car run. 

**What you will need:**
- An RC Toy Car with Wireless remote
- 4 1k resistor
- 4 2N3904 Transistor
- Raspberry pi (zero/2/3)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Soldering Iron
- Soldering Wire
- Hot Glue Gun (Optional)
- Lose wires (Two seperate colors)

We are not going to go too deep into the world of electronics and taking apart every bits and pieces because we are still trying to make sense of all of this how all of the components work. So here is how we will start.

**Step 1**

Solder 4 of the wires to the 4 switches and mark them with a tape. [^1]

[^1]You will need 4 control wires from the 4 switches on the controllers
