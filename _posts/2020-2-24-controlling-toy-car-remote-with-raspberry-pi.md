title: Control remote control toy car with raspberry pi (Controlling the remote)
---

Are you new to raspberry pi? May be you have never gone beyond making an LED blink. Well in that case I have just the project for you. This is fairly easy and simple way you can control a remote control car and make your own script to make the car run. 

**What you will need:**
1. An RC Toy Car
2. 1 1k resistor
3. 2 10k resistor
4. Raspberry pi (zero/2/3)
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper wires
