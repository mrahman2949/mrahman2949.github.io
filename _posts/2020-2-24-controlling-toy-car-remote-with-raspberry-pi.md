title: Control the remote control of a RC Car with Raspberry Pi (Zero, 2 or 3)
---

Are you new to raspberry pi? May be you have never gone beyond making an LED blink. Well in that case I have just the project for you. This is fairly easy and simple way you can control a remote control car and make your own script to make the car run. 

**What you will need:**
- An RC Toy Car with Wireless remote
- 4 1k resistor
- 4 2N3904 Transistor
- Raspberry pi (zero/2/3)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Soldering Iron
- Soldering Wire

**Step 1**
Pick the right toy car. For this project I went with a cheap 20 dollar RC Car from Walmart.
